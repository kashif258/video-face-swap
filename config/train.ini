# OPTIONS THAT APPLY TO ALL MODELS
# NB: UNLESS SPECIFICALLY STATED, VALUES CHANGED HERE WILL ONLY TAKE EFFECT WHEN CREATING A NEW MODEL.

# How to center the training image. The extracted images are centered on the middle of the skull based
# on the face's estimated pose. A subsection of these images are used for training. The centering used
# dictates how this subsection will be cropped from the aligned images.
#     - face: Centers the training image on the center of the face, adjusting for pitch and yaw.
#     - head: Centers the training image on the center of the head, adjusting for pitch and yaw. NB:
# 		You should only select head centering if you intend to include the full head (including hair) in
# 		the final swap. This may give mixed results. Additionally, it is only worth choosing head
# 		centering if you are training with a mask that includes the hair (e.g. BiSeNet-FP-Head).
#     - legacy: The 'original' extraction technique. Centers the training image near the tip of the
# 		nose with no adjustment. Can result in the edges of the face appearing outside of the training
# 		area.
# 
# Choose from: ['face', 'head', 'legacy']
# [Default: face]
centering = face

# How much of the extracted image to train on. A lower coverage will limit the model's scope to a
# zoomed-in central area while higher amounts can include the entire face. A trade-off exists between
# lower amounts given more detail versus higher amounts avoiding noticeable swap transitions. For
# 'Face' centering you will want to leave this above 75%. For Head centering you will most likely want
# to set this to 100%. Sensible values for 'Legacy' centering are:
#     - 62.5% spans from eyebrow to eyebrow.
#     - 75.0% spans from temple to temple.
#     - 87.5% spans from ear to ear.
#     - 100.0% is a mugshot.
# 
# Select a decimal number between 62.5 and 100.0
# [Default: 100.0]
coverage = 100.0

# How much to adjust the vertical position of the aligned face as a percentage of face image size.
# Negative values move the face up (expose more chin and less forehead). Positive values move the face
# down (expose less chin and more forehead)
# 
# Select an integer between -25 and 25

# NB:
#     - This can use more VRAM when creating a new model so you may want to lower the batch size for
# 		the first run. The batch size can be raised again when reloading the model.
#     - Multi-GPU is not supported for this option, so you should start the model on a single GPU.
# 		Once training has started, you can stop training, enable multi-GPU and resume.
#     - Building the model will likely take several minutes as the calculations for this

# 		exit.

lr_finder_mode = set

# How aggressively to set the Learning Rate. More aggressive can learn faster, but is more likely to
# lead to exploding gradients.
#     - default - The default optimal learning rate. A safe choice for nearly all use cases.
#     - aggressive - Set's a higher learning rate than the default. May learn faster but with a higher
# 		chance of exploding gradients.
#     - extreme - The highest optimal learning rate. A much higher risk of exploding gradients.
# 
# Choose from: ['default', 'aggressive', 'extreme']

# NVIDIA GPUs can run operations in float16 faster than in float32. Mixed precision allows you to use
# a mix of float16 with float32, to get the performance benefits from float16 and the numeric
# stability benefits from float32.
# 
# This is untested on non-Nvidia cards, but will run on most Nvidia models. it will only speed up
# training on more recent GPUs. Those with compute capability 7.0 or higher will see the greatest
# performance benefit from mixed precision because they have Tensor Cores. Older GPUs offer no math
# performance benefit for using mixed precision, however memory and bandwidth savings can enable some

# If a 'NaN' is generated in the model, this means that the model has corrupted and the model is

# [GPU Only]. The number of faces to feed through the model at once when running the Convert process.

# LOSS CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
# LOSS IS THE MECHANISM BY WHICH A NEURAL NETWORK JUDGES HOW WELL IT THINKS THAT IT IS RECREATING A
# FACE.
# NB: UNLESS SPECIFICALLY STATED, VALUES CHANGED HERE WILL ONLY TAKE EFFECT WHEN CREATING A NEW MODEL.

# The loss function to use.
# 
#     - ffl: Focal Frequency Loss. Analyzes the frequency spectrum of the images rather than the
# 		images themselves. This loss function can be used on its own, but the original paper found
# 		increased benefits when using it as a complementary loss to another spacial loss function (e.g.
# 		MSE). Ref: Focal Frequency Loss for Image Reconstruction and Synthesis
# 		https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12821.pdf NB: This loss does not currently work on AMD cards.
# 
#     - gmsd: Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation seeks to match the global standard deviation of
# 		the pixel to pixel differences between two images. Similar in approach to SSIM. Ref: Gradient
# 		Magnitude Similarity Deviation: An Highly Efficient Perceptual Image Quality Index
# 		https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1308/1308.3052.pdf
# 
#     - l_inf_norm: The L_inf norm will reduce the largest individual pixel error in an image. As each
# 		largest error is minimized sequentially, the overall error is improved. This loss will be
# 		extremely focused on outliers.
# 
#     - laploss: Laplacian Pyramid Loss. Attempts to improve results by focussing on edges using
# 		Laplacian Pyramids. As this loss function gives priority to edges over other low-frequency
# 		information, like color, it should not be used on its own. The original implementation uses this
# 		loss as a complimentary function to MSE. Ref: Optimizing the Latent Space of Generative Networks
# 		https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05776
# 
#     - logcosh: log(cosh(x)) acts similar to MSE for small errors and to MAE for large errors. Like
# 		MSE, it is very stable and prevents overshoots when errors are near zero. Like MAE, it is robust
# 		to outliers.
# 
#     - mae: Mean absolute error will guide reconstructions of each pixel towards its median value in
# 		the training dataset. Robust to outliers but as a median, it can potentially ignore some
# 		infrequent image types in the dataset.
# 
#     - ms_ssim: Multiscale Structural Similarity Index Metric is similar to SSIM except that it
# 		performs the calculations along multiple scales of the input image.
# 
#     - mse: Mean squared error will guide reconstructions of each pixel towards its average value in
# 		the training dataset. As an avg, it will be susceptible to outliers and typically produces
# 		slightly blurrier results. Ref: Multi-Scale Structural Similarity for Image Quality Assessment
# 		https://www.cns.nyu.edu/pub/eero/wang03b.pdf
# 
#     - pixel_gradient_diff: Instead of minimizing the difference between the absolute value of each
# 		pixel in two reference images, compute the pixel to pixel spatial difference in each image and
# 		then minimize that difference between two images. Allows for large color shifts, but maintains the
# 		structure of the image.
# 
#     - smooth_loss: Smooth_L1 is a modification of the MAE loss to correct two of its disadvantages.
# 		This loss has improved stability and guidance for small errors. Ref: A General and Adaptive Robust
# 		Loss Function https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03077.pdf
# 
#     - ssim: Structural Similarity Index Metric is a perception-based loss that considers changes in
# 		texture, luminance, contrast, and local spatial statistics of an image. Potentially delivers more
# 		realistic looking images. Ref: Image Quality Assessment: From Error Visibility to Structural
# 		Similarity http://www.cns.nyu.edu/pub/eero/wang03-reprint.pdf
#

# 'pixel_gradient_diff', 'smooth_loss', 'ssim']
# [Default: ssim]
loss_function = ssim

# The second loss function to use. If using a structural based loss (such as SSIM, MS-SSIM or GMSD) it
# is common to add an L1 regularization(MAE) or L2 regularization (MSE) function. You can adjust the
# weighting of this loss function with the loss_weight_2 option.
# 
#     - ffl: Focal Frequency Loss. Analyzes the frequency spectrum of the images rather than the
# 		images themselves. This loss function can be used on its own, but the original paper found
# 		increased benefits when using it as a complementary loss to another spacial loss function (e.g.

# 		https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12821.pdf NB: This loss does not currently work on AMD cards.
# 
#     - flip: Nvidia FLIP. A perceptual loss measure that approximates the difference perceived by
# 		humans as they alternate quickly (or flip) between two images. Used on its own and this loss
# 		function creates a distinct grid on the output. However it can be helpful when used as a
# 		complimentary loss function. Ref: FLIP: A Difference Evaluator for Alternating Images:
# 		https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/node/3260/FLIP_Paper.pdf

# 
#     - lpips_alex: LPIPS is a perceptual loss that uses the feature outputs of other pretrained
# 		models as a loss metric. Be aware that this loss function will use more VRAM. Used on its own and
# 		this loss will create a distinct moire pattern on the output, however it can be helpful as a
# 		complimentary loss function. The output of this function is strong, so depending on your chosen
# 		primary loss function, you are unlikely going to want to set the weight above about 25%. Ref: The
# 		Unreasonable Effectiveness of Deep Features as a Perceptual Metric http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03924

# 		NB: Epsilon for AdaBelief needs to be set to a smaller value than other Optimizers. Generally

#     - adam - Adaptive Moment Optimization. A stochastic gradient descent method that is based on
# 		adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments.
#     - adamax - a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm. Due to its capability of adjusting the
# 		learning rate based on data characteristics, it is suited to learn time-variant process,
# 		parameters follow those provided in the paper
#     - adamw - Like 'adam' but with an added method to decay weights per the techniques discussed in
# 		the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05101). NB: Weight decay should be set at 0.004 for default
# 		implementation.

# 		than relying on second-order moments (Adam). saves VRAM by only tracking the momentum. Performance
# 		gains should be better with larger batch sizes. A suitable learning rate for Lion is typically
# 		3-10x smaller than that for AdamW. The weight decay for Lion should be 3-10x larger than that for

#     - nadam - Adaptive Moment Optimization with Nesterov Momentum. Much like Adam but uses a
