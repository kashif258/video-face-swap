# OPTIONS FOR TRANSFERING THE COLOR DISTRIBUTION FROM THE SOURCE TO THE TARGET IMAGE USING THE MEAN

# THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS (LOOSELY) BASED ON THE 'COLOR TRANSFER BETWEEN IMAGES' PAPER BY REINHARD ET
# AL., 2001. MATCHING THE HISTOGRAMS BETWEEN THE SOURCE AND DESTINATION FACES.

# Should components of L*a*b* image be scaled by numpy.clip before converting back to BGR color space?

[color.manual_balance]
# OPTIONS FOR MANUALLY ALTERING THE BALANCE OF COLORS OF THE SWAPPED FACE

# The colorspace to use for adjustment: The three adjustment sliders will effect the image differently
# depending on which colorspace is selected:
#     - RGB: Red, Green, Blue. An additive colorspace where colors are obtained by a linear
# 		combination of Red, Green, and Blue values. The three channels are correlated by the amount of
# 		light hitting the surface. In RGB color space the color information is separated into three
# 		channels but the same three channels also encode brightness information.
#     - HSV: Hue, Saturation, Value. Hue - Dominant wavelength. Saturation - Purity / shades of color.
# 		Value - Intensity. Best thing is that it uses only one channel to describe color (H), making it
# 		very intuitive to specify color.
#     - LAB: Lightness, A, B. Lightness - Intensity. A - Color range from green to magenta. B - Color
# 		range from blue to yellow. The L channel is independent of color information and encodes
# 		brightness only. The other two channels encode color.
#     - YCrCb: Y - Luminance or Luma component obtained from RGB after gamma correction. Cr - how far
# 		is the red component from Luma. Cb - how far is the blue component from Luma. Separates the
# 		luminance and chrominance components into different channels.

# Select an integer between 1 and 9
# [Default: 3]

# [Default: 150]
amount = 150

# Affects the size of the edges to be enhanced or how wide the edge rims become, so a smaller radius
# enhances smaller-scale detail.
# Radius is set as a percentage of the final frame width and rounded to the nearest pixel. E.g for a
# 1280 width frame, a 0.6 percenatage will give a radius of 8px.
# Higher radius values can cause halos at the edges, a detectable faint light rim around objects. Fine
# detail needs a smaller radius.
# Radius and amount interact; reducing one allows more of the other.

# Select a decimal number between 0.1 and 5.0
# [Default: 0.3]

# [unsharp_mask only] Controls the minimal brightness change that will be sharpened or how far apart
# adjacent tonal values have to be before the filter does anything.
# This lack of action is important to prevent smooth areas from becoming speckled. The threshold
# setting can be used to sharpen more pronounced edges, while leaving subtler edges untouched.
# Low values should sharpen more because fewer areas are excluded.
